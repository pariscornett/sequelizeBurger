### Getting Started
Navigate to the location of this cloned repository on your device, and run `npm install` to acquire all the necessary dependencies.
You will need to have MySQL Workbench or SQL Pro in order to run this application.
Navigate to the .sql files. Copy and paste the schema.sql and seed.sql files (in that order) to your database.
Make sure you enter your unique MySQL identifiers (password, user, etc) into the .json file located within the `config` folder.
Now that you have everything properly set up, save your changes, and run `node server.js` in the terminal.
You should be able to click the link in the terminal to open up the port in your browser OR visit localhost:8080 in the browser to use the app.
